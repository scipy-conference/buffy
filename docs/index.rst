Buffy
=====
A service to provide a bot helping scientific journals manage submission reviews.

Buffy automates common editorial tasks like those needed by the `Journal of Open Source Software <http://joss.theoj.org/>`_ or `rOpenSci <https://ropensci.org/>`_.

Buffy provides a bot that interacts during the peer-review process with editors, reviewers and authors to help them perform actions on the review, the software being reviewed and its corresponding paper.

Buffy is an Open Source project, `the code <https://github.com/openjournals/buffy>`_ is hosted at GitHub and released under a MIT license.
